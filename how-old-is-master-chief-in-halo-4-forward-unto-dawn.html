By the age of 17, he had officially been decorated as a Master Chief - albeit only so UNSC Marines and Drop-Troopers would obey his orders.<h2>Who is the shortest Spartan in Halo?</h2>In order from largest to smallest, the smallest Spartans are: Daisy-023 at just under 6'3", Olivia-G291 at 5'10" and Lucy at 5'3" (age 12).
