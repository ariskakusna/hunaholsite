That’s a remarkable feat in this day and age seeing as how his projects like <a href=#>Supernatural</a> with <a href=#>Jensen Ackles</a> have had incredible staying power.</p><p>It’s been a mostly great run for the actor, though there was one slip-up along the way.</p><h4 class=wp-block-heading id=h-jared-padalecki-was-arrested-for-a-bar-fight><strong>JARED PADALECKI WAS ARRESTED FOR A BAR FIGHT</strong></h4><p>For the most part, Jared Padalecki has been in the news for good reasons. He married his Supernatural co-star, Genevieve Cortese, in 2010 and the couple remains married and has three kids.</p><p>He launched a T-shirt campaign called Always Keep Fighting through <a href=#>Represent.com</a> in an effort to fight depression, something the actor has had to deal with in the past. But things got messy for the actor when he found himself under arrest.</p><p>This happened in his hometown of Austin, Texas where Jared Padalecki owns the bar, Stereotype. Padalecki allegedly had a bit too much to drink and got into an altercation with two of his employees. During this verbal argument, Jared Padalecki hit both in the face.</p><p>The video of his scuffle and arrest can be seen below.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p></p></figure><p>In the TMZ video, Padalecki is putting another man in a headlock. It was not a good night for Jared Padalecki. Police arrived and in another video clip, it appears that Jared pulled out a wad of cash in an attempt to pay off the cops.</p><p>He was eventually arrested and charged with three counts, two for assault and one for public intoxication. He was released on $15,000 bail, $5,000 for each count.</p><h4 class=wp-block-heading id=h-jared-padalecki-is-on-instagram><strong>JARED PADALECKI IS ON INSTAGRAM</strong></h4><p>With more than 6.3 million followers on Instagram, we can definitely say that Jared Padalecki is active on the social media platform. His feed is a mix of career highlights, family photos, and upcoming projects.</p><p>From this standpoint, the actor understands fan engagement and how to keep those folks engaged with what is happening in and around his career. And he knows how to have some fun where his current series is concerned. Check out the Walker, references in the post below.</p><h4 class=wp-block-heading id=h-jared-padalecki-is-walker-the-new-texas-ranger><strong>JARED PADALECKI IS WALKER, THE NEW TEXAS RANGER</strong></h4><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.giantfreakinrobot.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/jared-padalecki-walker-texas-ranger-900x596.png><p>Jared Padalecki and The CW are closing in on their second decade of working together with the star moving off of one hit series and onto another. That’s come in the form of Walker, which has Padalecki starring as the titular Texas Ranger.</p><p>The show is a reboot of the Chuck Norris-led Walker, Texas Ranger which aired on CBS in the 1990s and early 2000s. In the new show, Jared Padalecki plays Cordell Walker, a lawman with something of a past who is now tasked with stopping the neer-do-wells in the area.</p><p>Walker has been a solid performer for The CW since it came on the air in 2021. The viewership numbers started off very strong for the first season, though they’ve dipped for the second. It’s currently in its third season with plans up in the air around whether things will continue after this run of stories.</p><p>Before this, Jared Padalecki had quite the career on the network and he’s become a major star in his own right.</p><h4 class=wp-block-heading id=h-jared-padalecki-was-on-gilmore-girls><strong>JARED PADALECKI WAS ON GILMORE GIRLS</strong></h4><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.giantfreakinrobot.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/gilmoregirls-900x599.jpg><p>Jared Padalecki’s career started fast. He first starred on the big screen in a baseball movie called A Little Inside and then made an appearance in a TV movie titled Silent Witness before jumping into the deep end.</p><p>In 2000, Padalecki was cast in the hit series <a href=#>Gilmore Girls</a>, where he was introduced in the pilot episode as Dean Forester, the new guy in town. He quickly catches the eye of Rory Gilmore (Alexis Bledel).</p><p>Of course, as life would have it on a soap opera, things get complicated for Dean and Rory as other characters are introduced. Rory’s mom Lorelai gets herself involved, to add to the complication, and eventually, things end up where the two split.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.giantfreakinrobot.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/gilmoregirls2-900x1121.jpg><p>Jared Padalecki’s character was recurring in Gilmore Girls Season 1, then became a main character in Seasons 2 and 3. He went back to recurring status for Seasons 4 and 5 and it was Season 5 when Dean left for good, never to be seen or heard from again. Almost.</p><p>Jared Padalecki made an appearance in the short revival of Gilmore Girls called Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life where he reconnected one more time with Rory, the two acknowledging how their time together taught them a lot about life. When Padalecki’s time ended on Gilmore Girls, he moved right into thing two.</p><h4 class=wp-block-heading id=h-he-was-sam-winchester-in-supernatural><strong>HE WAS SAM WINCHESTER IN SUPERNATURAL</strong></h4><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.giantfreakinrobot.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/supernatural-1-900x506.jpg><p>Jared Padalecki moved right into his next big gig immediately after his run on Gilmore Girls and this is perhaps what he is now best known for. We are talking about the hit CW show Supernatural created by Eric Kripke.</p><p>Supernatural first premiered on <a href=#>The WB</a> network, which eventually became the CW. Jared Padalecki starred as <a href=#>Sam Winchester</a>, brother to Jensen Ackles’ <a href=#>Dean Winchester</a>. They were raised by their father to be Hunters, humans who hunt down anything supernatural: demons, monsters, ghosts, or any creature that poses a threat to humans.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.giantfreakinrobot.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/supernatural2.jpg><p>Supernatural has enjoyed an extremely lengthy and popular run on WB/The CW. The show has lasted for 15 seasons, with its final season airing back in 2020.</p><p>The Winchester Brothers’ backstories are quite involved, which isn’t all that surprising considering the series ran for 15 years. But its popularity is unquestioned, with many fans asking for more, even when the series had not yet concluded.</p><p>Though the final season was cut a bit short because of the pandemic and the finale had to change from the original idea, there’s no doubt that Jared Padalecki and Jensen Ackles had one of the truly surprising hit television shows we’ve seen in quite some time.</p><p>That being said, it was a little surprising that he hasn’t been involved with the prequel series The Winchesters. Jensen Ackles helped create the show about Jobn Winchester and Mary Campbell, Dean and Sam’s parents.</p><h4 class=wp-block-heading id=h-jared-padalecki-was-in-friday-the-13th><strong>JARED PADALECKI WAS IN FRIDAY THE 13TH</strong></h4><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.giantfreakinrobot.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/friday13th-1-900x630.jpg><p>Jared Padalecki once stated his draw toward Supernatural was because of his love for horror movies. Not only did that reflect in his decision to star in the series, but also for some of the choices he made during the show’s run.</p><p>While pre-Supernatural, Padalecki was seen in features such as Cheaper By the Dozen, New York Minute (with the Olsen Twins), and Flight of the Phoenix, his movie career during his Supernatural time leaned more toward horror fare.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.giantfreakinrobot.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/13th-900x923.jpg><p>House of Wax, Cry Wolf, and House of Fears were part of his movie choices before he took the lead in the 2009 reboot of Friday the 13th. In it, Jared Padalecki played Clay Miller, the brother of a young girl who has gone missing around the famous Camp Crystal Lake. He arrives with friends and his search for his sister begins.</p><p>Because this was a Friday the 13th movie, his friends begin to get picked off one by one. As far as Friday the 13th movies go, it could have been worse. They did have a few stinkers in the franchise (Friday the 13th Part VIII: Jason Takes Manhattan, Jason X) but it didn’t quite hit that level of stink.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qLXAp6ufqpWWuKq60aiZqKxemLyue9Oop6KbX5%2Bus7HDZqeanJGhsqS3yA%3D%3D</p></div><div id=links><a href=./the-truth-about-the-vanderpump-rules-editing-scandal.html>&#171;&nbsp;The Truth About The Vanderpump Rules Editing Scandal</a>
