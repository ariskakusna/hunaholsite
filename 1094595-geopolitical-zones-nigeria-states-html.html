He said:</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/bc8031a1a04ab85d.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Uncertainty as internet reaches remote Amazon</span></p></a>There's been a transition in the last few years regarding political representation. The geopolitical arrangement came with the Abacha constitution that never saw the light of day. Abacha said let's have six geopolitical zones named after the North and South and their divisions. So these geopolitical zones represent some fairly cultural, homogeneous groups, not exactly, but some idea that something is binding members of the same geopolitical zone together.So when Abacha died and the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) came to power, it seemed to have implemented this aspect of the Abacha constitution in several respects. Principally, the PDP insisted through its zoning system that each geopolitical zone must have a key political office in Nigeria's governance. So you had President Obasanjo (from the Southwest), and he picked Atiku from the North- East as his vice president; the Senate President went to the Southeast, the Deputy Senate President came to the North-Central, the Speaker of the House of Representatives went to the Southwest, and the deputy speaker to the South-South or so on.<a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/vllkytr4mv3f8sqb4.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=28><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>N1,000/litre: Fuel crisis hits Nigerian border communities as petrol prices skyrocket</span></p></a>The PDP realized that this kind of thing was very good for the country's stabilization, but when the All Progressive Congress (APC), led by Buhari, first came to power, they tried to destroy that tradition completely. So you had the president from the Northwest, the vice president from the Southwest, and the president of the Senate, initially Bukola Saraki from the North-Central (but you know what happened. This was not the original plan, which did not put North-Central in the calculation). The Southeast had no key position. All Service Chiefs at a point were from the North. But when they returned in 2019, everything went haywire, and the geopolitical arrangement regarding power-sharing by geopolitical zones in the country collapsed. And, of course, for some of us, the thing is that where ethnic majorities control the country, they control the press, they control the outcome of elections, having the voting numbers, so they do whatever they want. And Buhari got away with it.<a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/1ed272ae4c12c489.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Rich-poor split could tighten 'grip of poverty': World Bank chief</span></p></a>In APC's second coming, led by Tinubu, I think they are trying to somehow correct that. And so you have some fair return to the geopolitical arrangement, with each geopolitical zone having at least one key political office. I hope that this is sustained and sustainable because it's about identity, it's about inclusion, it's about taking people along, it's about people feeling that they're also important, regardless of the number of votes they have, but they are part of the Nigerian society, and so they have to be represented.So when key appointments respect that distribution, it's very good for the country. Unfortunately, when people hold such positions, they don't seem to think they are representing these geopolitical zones; they represent themselves; that's unfortunate. So I hope that one day, people will realize that they are presenting specific political constituencies to bring inclusion and not represent themselves and escape poverty as individuals.<a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/1b1a68db5a36c430.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Feder Government urged to make law for efficient port services</span></p></a><h2 id=1094595-how-many-states-are-in-nigeria class=table-of-contents__scroll-section>How many states are in Nigeria?</h2><p class=align-left>Nigeria is comprised of 36 states and the Federal Capital Territory (FCT), Abuja.
