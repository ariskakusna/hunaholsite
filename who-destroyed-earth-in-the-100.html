That left the entire planet a wasteland and uninhabitable.</span></span><h2>Why did Alie destroy the world?</h2>A.L.I.E. believes that the root problem of humanity is "too many people", seeing overpopulation as a threat to human survival. To solve this issue, in 2052, she launched a nuclear strike with the intention to save humanity from extinction by wiping out the majority of Earth's human inhabitants.<h2>What caused the radiation in The 100?</h2>It was caused by the failing nuclear power plants around the world which resulted in a wave of radiation spreading across the world. As a result of the rise in atmospheric radiation, the ground was uninhabitable for everyone except Nightbloods for the next five years.<h2>How did the Earth explode in The 100?</h2>A.L.I.E decided to cause a nuclear exchange to end the world, the simple reason being there were too many people to sustain the planet's resources. Apocalypse One took place 97 years before the events in The 100. This resulted in the Earth being completely destroyed and people fleeing out into space.<h2>What is suicide by Earth in The 100?</h2>Suicide by Earth<p>According to Bellamy Blake, pods similar to Raven's were used in years past by Sky People as a form of suicide. Lincoln encountered one of these people still alive when he was a boy and for three days tried to help him before his father made Lincoln kill the man.</p><h2>The 100 - A.L.I.E Destroys The World</h2><p></p><h2>Who is commander after Lexa?</h2>Ontari was a recurring character during the third season. She was portrayed by actress Rhiannon Fish and debuted in "Watch the Thrones". Ontari was a Nightblood from the Ice Nation and after Lexa's death came to Polis in order to become the next Commander.<h2>Is Clarke a Nightblood?</h2>In Season 4, Clarke injects herself with more Nightblood, i.e. Luna's blood marrow, as part of Abby's research into alternate survival plans for Praimfaya. Apparently, this made her a proper Nightblood, giving Clarke the ability to survive the radiation that Praimfaya unleases on the planet.<h2>How long did The 100 sleep?</h2>Everyone went into cryo sleep for 10 years aboard the space ship, hoping that Earth would begin to come back to life after a decade and they could all return to the ground. In a blink of an eye, Clarke and Bellamy woke up. But they were confused as to why they were the only ones revived.<h2>Why did The 100 leave Earth again?</h2>Survivors in space believed Earth to be uninhabitable, but after a critical system failure in the Ark's life support systems, the 100 were sent to the surface in a last-ditch attempt to determine if Earth is habitable again. There they discovered that the Grounders have been living on the ground for generations.<h2>Why did it say End Book One at the end of The 100?</h2>He went on to explain: “We have been following our own road map from the beginning and so in my mind, the end of Book One means the first five seasons were Book One of the encyclopedia of The 100 adventures and Book Two begins as they set down on this new planet next year.”<h2>Who started the war in The 100?</h2>It began when the Artificial Intelligence A.L.I.E. instigated a global nuclear exchange. Earth was left in ruins as a result, with the majority of inhabitants killed and the planet simmering in radiation. This apocalyptic event is also known as "the Bombs" or "the Fire".<h2>Who opens the bunker in The 100?</h2>Bellamy proceeds to open the door and go outside where he finds Octavia and Indra waiting. Bellamy hugs Octavia and tells her that he loves her and, Octavia says "I knew you could do it." With the doors open, 1,100 Grounders come inside.<h2>Why did Clarke stay on Earth?</h2>Clarke sacrifices herself and stays on Earth, but her Nightblood allows her to survive. Clarke survives in the only inhabitable land left on Earth, Shadow Valley, with her daughter Madi, another Nightblood she found after Praimfaya.<h2>Did Jasper take the chip?</h2>A.L.I.E.'s foot soldiers have insider information. After everything he saw at Luna's rig, Jasper has voluntarily decided to take the chip. This tragic reveal is executed in a beautiful way.<h2>How does Alie know about Jaha?</h2>Once it was in her possession she was able to read any code that existed on it (not a technical person but I'm assuming he had to program... something...to get that thing to safely launch him to earth lol). Since Jaha was the one who programmed it, his info was on it, hence she "knew" who was when he arrived.<h2>Does Clarke become commander?</h2>Clarke Griffin was briefly implanted with the Flame to destroy A.L.I.E. , but she never took the title of Commander at least in part because she was not a Nightblood at the time and could not survive hosting the Flame permanently. She was however called "Commander" by Becca Franko when she entered the City of Light.<h2>What planet did The 100 go to?</h2>Alpha, which is actually a moon, not a planet, was settled and later became Sanctum, the main setting of The 100 season 6.<h2>Who is Octavia's dad?</h2>A The 100 Fact: IN THE ORIGINAL SCRIPT, IT WAS SUPPOSED TO BE REVEALED THAT KANE IS OCTAVIA AND BELLAMY'S FATHER, BUT THE PLOT LINE WAS SOON DROPPED. JASPER WAS ALSO SUPPOSED TO COMMIT SUICIDE IN THE SEASON 3 FINALE, BUT THAT WAS - WELL...<h2>What year is The 100 based on?</h2>Plot. Set in 2149, 97 years after a nuclear apocalypse has devastated the surface of Earth, the only survivors were approximately 400 inhabitants of 12 national space stations that were in orbit at the time. Three generations have survived in space.<h2>Who was the commander before Lexa?</h2>As for who was Heda before Lexa, that's unknown. Anya was heda all through season 1 until she died in front of Camp Jaha (at the time). When Anya died she instructed Clarke to go to her second (Lexa) to help band together the people.<h2>Why is echo a Nightblood?</h2>Abby states that they failed because they didn't know the formula and Russell gives them a day to do it. In "Ashes to Ashes", Abby succeeds and Echo is transformed into a Nightblood by Ryker Desai.<h2>Was Lexa an AI in The 100?</h2>The upgrade is that the second AI is augmented by a human being, by humanity, and the first one was not. Lexa's not an AI, Lexa is a woman who happens to have an augmented consciousness in the form of this AI.<h2>Who has Clarke slept with?</h2>Clarke kisses Niylah and they have sex. In Wanheda (Part 2), Niylah is seen being beaten and thrown around inside her trading post by Roan's partner.<h2>Why did Lexa betray Clarke?</h2>First, Lexa broke the pact between the Grounders and the Arkers when she made a deal to save her own people at Mount Weather at the expense of the Arkers. She made the decision to betray Clarke and sacrifice the 47 left behind in Mount Weather.<h2>Who does Octavia end up with?</h2>Octavia & Diyoza<p>These two meet on opposite ends of a war for the planet, but end up having to survive, just the two of them and Diyoza's daughter Hope, on a planet away from everyone else they know. During that time, they're a family.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrTnqmvoZWsrrOxwGeaqKVfm66ye9ahpmaclajBs7vYnptmnZGnwal5yKdkraCVYn5xfA%3D%3D</p></div><div id=links><a href=./who-is-christian-navarro-dating-now-past-relationships-current-relationship-status-and-rumours-html.html>&#171;&nbsp;Who is Christian Navarro Dating Now?
