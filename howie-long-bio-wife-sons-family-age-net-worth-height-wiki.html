a football player, Howie played for the Oakland/Los Angeles Raiders as a defensive end.&nbsp;As an actor, he has appeared in a number of films such as&nbsp;</span><span>Broken Arrow</span><span>&nbsp;(1996) and&nbsp;</span><span>Firestorm</span><span>&nbsp;(1998).&nbsp;Outside of sports broadcasting, Long works for Fox Network and Fox Sports as an NFL analyst and

child.&nbsp;His mother, who suffered from epilepsy, could not raise him alone, so he lived with his grandmother and uncles who helped him raise him.</span></p><p><span>After completing his elementary and middle school, Lange returned to Massachusetts where he attended Milford High School.&nbsp;At Milford he was an all-around sports star, competing in football, basketball and track events (including javelin, shot put and discus) for three years.&nbsp;Howie, who didn’t start playing soccer until he was fifteen, got so good at the game during high school that he was even called up to the Scholastic Coach All-America team as a senior.</span></p><p><span>After high school, Howie Long enrolled at Villanova University in Radnor, Pennsylvania, where he joined the college football team and received the letters throughout his four years of college.&nbsp;In addition to football, Long also competed in boxing, emerging as the Northern Collegiate Heavyweight Boxing Champion at

1990).</span></p><p><span>All three sons of Howie Long are actively involved in football.&nbsp;His first son, known simply as Chris Long, played for the Philadelphia Eagles as a defensive end.&nbsp;Chris retired from professional football on May 18, 2019.&nbsp;He married Megan O’Malley in 2013 and they have one son, Waylon James Long.&nbsp;Howie’s second son, Kyle Long, plays for the
