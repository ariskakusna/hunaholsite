Although he has seen and reviewed a lot of movies, Doug Walker said the worst movie he came across was&nbsp;</span><span>The Trash Children’s Movie</span><span>&nbsp;(1987), while the best was the 1985 movie&nbsp;</span><span>Brazil</span></p><p><span>2. It started with That Guy With the Glasses and it lasted until 2014 when it turned into Channel Awesome.</span></p><p><span>3. Even though he was forced to quit YouTube due to some issues, he has since returned to the platform with his various channels.</span></p><p><span>4. Nostalgia Critic and Channel Awesome, the YouTube channel, have a close following of one million subscribers and over half a billion video views.</span></p><p><span>5 In early 2018, fans speculated that Doug called it Channel Awesome’s resignation.&nbsp;But then it happens to have a big presence, but it was Channel Awesome who faced challenges when it came to accusations of sexism and sexual abuse.</span></p><p><span>6. If you are wondering how tall he is, he stands at a height of 1.79m, but his height is not known.</span></p><p><span>7.
