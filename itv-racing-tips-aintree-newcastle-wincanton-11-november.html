Ned Fox is good value for his 3lb claim and this youngster should have more to offer.&nbsp;</p><p><b>Selection: </b>Enjoy Your Life @ <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">6/1 with Betfred</a></p><h3>1.30, Newcastle – Virgin Bet Daily Extra Places Irish EBF Gillies Fillies’ Stakes (1m 2f, Listed)</h3><p>Veil Of Shadows had Rousay, Persist and <b>MUKADDAMAH</b> in behind when a fine second in the Pride Stakes last time, but that was on soft ground – and the last of that quartet is expected to reverse the form.&nbsp;</p><p>Mukaddamah was the shortest-priced of the four that day but struggles when conditions are testing, and her previous second in Yarmouth’s John Musker Stakes stands out in this field. She is one from one on the all-weather and her style of racing suits this track.&nbsp;</p><p><b>Selection:</b> Mukaddamah @ <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">6/1 with Betfred</a></p><h3>1.50, Wincanton – Boodles “Rising Stars” Novices’ Chase (2m 4f, Grade 2)</h3><p>If this Grade 2 novice chase were a handicap, <b>KNAPPERS HILL</b> would be conceding 13lb to second favourite Captain Conby, and 23lb and upwards to the other runners.&nbsp;</p><p>He is a short-priced favourite but deserves to be, given he was the best of these over hurdles and shaped encouragingly when second on his chasing debut off level weights to smart second-season novice Unexpected Party.</p><p><b>Selection:</b> Knappers Hill @ <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">8/13 with Betfred</a></p><h3>2.05, Newcastle – Virgin Bet Every Saturday Money Back Wentworth Stakes (6f, Listed)</h3><p>Most of the runners can be pigeon-holed as high-class handicappers and <b>SENSE OF DUTY</b> is a cut above these rivals if putting her best foot forward.</p><p>While she struggled in the Champions Sprint last time, that was a Group 1, and her connections were rushing to get her there after an interrupted preparation. This is much weaker and she served up her lifetime best over course and distance three starts ago.&nbsp;</p><p><b>Selection:</b> Sense Of Duty @ <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">5/2 with Betfred</a></p><h3>2.25, Wincanton – 62nd Badger Beer Handicap Chase (3m 1f)</h3><p>Frodon, one of the most popular jumps horses in training, is bound to have his supporters as he defends his Badger Beer title. There is a lingering doubt about soft ground, however, as he generally prefers a quicker surface.</p><p><b>BLACKJACK MAGIC</b> rates the better-value wager, with Rex Dingle’s booking suggesting he is the first string among four Anthony Honeyball-trained runners. This unexposed chaser will love conditions and is well weighted to cause an upset.&nbsp;</p><p><b>Selection:</b> Blackjack Magic @ <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">12/1 with Betfred</a></p><h3>2.45, Aintree – BoyleSports Grand Sefton Handicap Chase (2m 5f)</h3><p>Gesskille has been well supported this week, but he has plenty of interesting opponents. Percussion is weighted to go well for Laura Morgan, but <b>NASSALAM</b> could be the answer if he takes to the National fences.</p><p>The six-year-old gelding is quirky, but certainly capable of landing a major handicap chase on soft ground if he is interested. He is 3lb lower than when he began the previous season – and given his age, he remains open to further progress. And 5lb claimer Caoilin Quinn is a positive booking.&nbsp;</p><p><b>Selection:</b> Nassalam @ <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">8/1 with Betfred</a></p><h3>3.00, Wincanton – JenningsBet Elite Hurdle (1m 7f)</h3><p>The Elite Hurdle looks like a straight shootout between Rubaud and <b>HANSARD</b>, with the latter handed the vote on these conditions in receipt of 6lb.</p><p>Rubaud is race-fit but his form is all on a sound surface, while Hansard appears to like it testing and gets 6lb from the favourite. His strong-travelling Grade 1 fourth at Aintree when last seen suggests he can rate much higher over hurdles.&nbsp;</p><p><b>Selection:</b> Hansard @ <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">6/4 with Betfred</a></p><h3>3.20, Aintree – BoyleSports Acca Boost On Horse Racing Hurdle (2m 4f)</h3><p>This is a trappy three-runner conditions hurdle in which no runner can be ruled out, with all of the trio arriving as past winners on Merseyside. Millers Bank struck at the top level here, but is a better chaser than hurdler.</p><p>This may not be contested to suit West Balboa, the most progressive of the three in the field, and <b>BREWIN’UPASTORM</b> rates the one to beat. These kinds of races are his bread and butter, and the 10-year-old is sure to be revved up to get the job done.&nbsp;</p><p><b>Selection: </b>Brewin’upastorm @ <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">7/4 with Betfred</a></p><h3>3.32, Wincanton – JenningsBet Richard Barber Memorial Mares’ Handicap Hurdle (2m 5½f)</h3><p>Ilovenightlife showed plenty of grit to land a Grade 2 mares’ novice handicap hurdle at Newbury last season and is temptingly treated off a mark of 125. However, similar comments apply to <b>VICKI VALE</b>, who goes off 113 with Tristan Durrell’s 5lb claim factored in.</p><p>Dan Skelton clearly thinks plenty of her, now a six-year-old, as he threw her into Grade 1 company against the boys on just her second run last term. That plan did not come off, but we surely have not seen the best of her yet and her wind surgery should help.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><b>Selection: </b>Vicki Vale @ <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">9/2 with Betfred</a></p><h3>3.45, Newcastle – Virgin Bet November Handicap (1m 4½f)</h3><p>The November Handicap has switched from the turf at Doncaster to the all-weather on Tyneside – and wherever the race is run,<b> LOCAL DYNASTY</b> stands out as a Group horse in a handicap.</p><p>He has shaped much better than the result when placing on his previous two starts in handicaps (one at Royal Ascot and one at Newmarket’s July meeting) and it looks significant that his in-form trainer Charlie Appleby has kept him on the go for this lucrative prize.</p><p><b>Selection: </b>Local Dynasty @ <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">4/1 with Betfred</a></p><h3>Want to find out more about the latest UK horse racing action?</h3><p>For more expert opinion on the latest ITV Racing card, check out these <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">ITV Racing insights from bettingexpert</a>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbHLnp6rmaCde6S7ja6iaJqVqcGqusZoqZqbmaO0cLXTr2SrmZOeu6h506KnrGWRnru1vsSeZKedp5iutMDLnmSwoZ6Yrq%2FAzqdkamldo7y3scybnKtn</p></div><div id=links><a href=./apple-vice-president-environment-lisa-jackson-interview.html>&#171;&nbsp;Apples Vice President of Environment Lisa Jackson wants to save the world by 2030 - and heres</a>
