In "Neptune's Spatula," he has two left hands. In "The Splinter," he also says that he is ambidextrous. Though, an explanation for this is that SpongeBob can regrow his appendages like real sponges.</span></span><h2>What is SpongeBob's dominant hand?</h2>When SpongeBob asked Patrick a question about his dominant hand, the only choices he gave were "right-handed" and "left-handed", and the correct answer was "ambidextrous"; this was not one of the possible answers that he gave out. The Magic Shop from F.U.N. is seen again.<h2>Is SpongeBob both handed?</h2>SpongeBob is ambidextrous, meaning he is able to write with both hands. SpongeBob's last name is SquarePants, but all of his relatives are round, except Stanley, who is part square, as it was revealed in season five, episode twenty, "Banned in Bikini Bottom/Stanley S. SquarePants".<h2>Is SpongeBob black?</h2>The two even share a breakup song. SpongeBob, was harder to categorize, but at the end of the day, we mostly agreed with Vice. SpongeBob is a light-skinned black character who may be able to pass as white in some situations.<h2>Is SpongeBob pansexual?</h2>Some argued that SpongeBob's orientation has already been firmly established — in 2005, series creator Stephen Hillenburg told reporters from The Associated Press that SpongeBob is asexual.<h2>SPONGEBOB LEFT ME A NOTE IN REAL LIFE! *What Does It Say!?*</h2><p></p><h2>Is SpongeBob a virgin?</h2>Made in 2001, shortly after 9/11, SpongeBob Loses His Virginity is a lost short where SpongeBob has sex with Sandy Cheeks.<h2>Is SpongeBob straight?</h2>Back in 2005, creator of Spongebob Squarepants Stephen Hillenburg firmly said that Spongebob is neither straight nor gay. “It doesn't have anything to do with what we're trying to do,” he said to Reuters, according to People.<h2>What did SpongeBob say backwards?</h2>When SpongeBob and Patrick are talking backwards, in reverse they are saying: "Hey, Patrick," "I give up," and "To get to the opposite side." The original closed-captions said "(speaking gibberish)."<h2>What is SpongeBob's full name?</h2>A square yellow sponge named SpongeBob SquarePants lives in a pineapple with his pet snail, Gary, in the city of Bikini Bottom on the floor of the Pacific Ocean. He works as a fry cook at the Krusty Krab.<h2>Is Squidward left handed?</h2>Squidward is right-handed, as seen in Artist Unknown, where he tries to draw a circle.<h2>How old is SpongeBob human years?</h2>While he is now 30 years-old in human years, according to Stephen Hillenburg, he is a solid 50 in "SpongeBob years".<h2>Is YY yellow or blue?</h2>Yy is the heterozygous genotype (one dominant allele, one recessive allele). The phenotype of this genotype is yellow seed color. yy is the homozygous dominant genotype (2 y alleles). The phenotype of this genotype is green seed color.<h2>Are SpongeBob and Patrick dating?</h2>"No one is shut out." Says Mr. Hillenburg: "I always think of them as being somewhat asexual." SpongeBob and Patrick don't live together, but it's not uncommon to see them holding hands.<h2>What is the Krabby Patty secret formula?</h2>In "The Great Patty Caper," at least 2 ingredients are confirmed: flour, barnacle shavings. And 2 possible ingredients are salt, and turmeric. Another confirmed ingredient is love, which is revealed in the episodes "Plankton's Army" and "Growth Spout," and The SpongeBob Movie: Sponge Out of Water.<h2>How old is Squidward?</h2>He is 43 and is very mature. He likes to play his Clarinet and is an artist. He used to have long yellow hair but then they fell off when he was at the Krusty Krab. His rival is Squilliam Fancyson.<h2>Is Squidward straight?</h2>“Squidward is a very overlooked character. He's designed to be tormented by SpongeBob,” says Sarah, a 20-year-old fan who asked to remain semi-anonymous because she's not out as bisexual to her family. After coming out as bisexual, Sarah gained more respect for Squidward, she says. “Oh, he's bi,” she realized.<h2>Who is SpongeBob's boyfriend?</h2>Several moments from the show's earlier seasons have resurfaced and been immortalized as memes in the last couple of years, including one still which shows SpongeBob and his best friend (or boyfriend?) Patrick both with limp wrists, foreshadowing this revelation by Nickelodeon.<h2>Is Plankton a cockroach?</h2>In "Plankton's Army," Plankton disguises himself as a cockroach. In "Ghost Host," the Flying Dutchman turns into a giant cockroach. In "To Save a Squirrel" and "Feral Friends," cockroaches are briefly mentioned.<h2>What is Plankton's Chum made of?</h2>Plankton and Karen are left on the street as their restaurant is condemned. The fact that chum is made of fish means the whole point of Plankton's business is to make the Bikini Bottomites engage in cannibalism.<p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrTnqmvoZWsrrOxwGeaqKVfm66ye8isZKyon6O0pq7Om2SlnZaperC%2BjKugoKCkYrWiusOemw%3D%3D</p></div><div id=links><a href=./jaycee-horn-age-wiki-biography-wife-children-salary-net-worth-parents-html.html>&#171;&nbsp;Jaycee Horn Age, Wiki, Biography, Wife, Children, Salary, Net Worth, Parents</a>
