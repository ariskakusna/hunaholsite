Absolutely! But don't be surprised if they want the standards of the church to be respected (which include chastity before marriage, avoiding alcohol, no smoking and other teachings). You may hear your Mormon guy or gal refer to a "Temple Marriage".<h2>Can Mormons get divorced?</h2>If a husband and wife are sealed together in the temple, they can be together on into the celestial kingdom. However, the church does have a process for annulment and sees divorce as an unfortunately necessary evil.<h2>Do Mormons celebrate Christmas?</h2>There are no midnight services. No liturgical edicts. No prescribed performances. But, yes, Mormons celebrate Christmas.<h2>What is expected of a Mormon woman?</h2>Mormon women have the specific responsibility to be righteous daughters of God; good, faithful wives; and loving mothers. A woman should give her greatest priority to her home: her husband, her family, and the opportunity to child-bearing.

Mormons ages 40-59 have had an average of 3.4 children in their lifetime, well above the comparable figure for all Americans in that age range (2.1) and higher than any other religious group.<h2>How many husbands can a Mormon woman have?</h2>In as much as this church of Christ has been reproached with the crime of fornication, and polygamy: we declare that we believe, that one man should have one wife; and one woman, but one husband, except in the case of death, when either is at liberty to marry again.<h2>What is the Mormon lifestyle?</h2>Mormons follow a strict healthy lifestyle that doesn't allow them to consume alcohol, tobacco, coffee or tea. Family life, good deeds, respect for authority and missionary work are important values in Mormonism.<h2>What are Mormon rules on dating?</h2>“Do not date until you are at least 16 years old.
