新月は満月の日に実り多き収穫を得られるようにテーマを決めて種まきをする、つまり、物事をスタートさせるのにおすすめ。一方、新月から蓄えてきたパワーが最大に蓄積される満月前後は、何かをいったん手放したり、軌道修正をするのにベストな日。
月の満ち欠けというリズムを意識しながら行動すると、小さな変化が大きな幸運へとつながるのがわかるはず！ October10月の開運ポイントKEYWORD :愛とお金で豊かになる
新月：2023年10月15日天秤座満月：2023年10月29日牡牛座新月・天秤座 ▶かけがえのないパートナーを得る収入を意味する2ハウスで起こる天秤座の新月。人間関係がうまくいけば仕事も自然とスムーズに進み、利益も大きくなる。金環日食でもあるため、１人で事を起こすのは勇気が出ない人でも、能力を認めてプロデュースしてくれる人が現れるなど、「誰かと組む」ことで収入につながる暗示。
パートナー募集中の場合は、今後の金脈への道へ誘ってくれる相手に出会える予感。２人でおもしろいビジネスを生み出せないか考えてみて。過去を表すドラゴンテイルの影響で、過去の経験を活かすことで思いがけない展開が訪れるだろう。
満月・牡牛座 ▶豊かな波動に包まれて豊穣の月と言われる牡牛座の満月で起こる部分月食。月と木星が接近し、とてもリッチなムードが漂いそうだ。金銭的に恵まれたパートナーとの出会い、ラグジュアリーな場所への招待など、豊かなエネルギーを実感できる出来事が起こる予感。
素材にこだわったものを食べにいくなど、良質なものに自分の波動を合わせるようイメージすると、それが現実になる。特に気をつけたいのは買い物。「安いから」を理由に購入したものは、あなたの波動を下げるので気をつけたい。
November11月の開運ポイントKEYWORD :変容のための準備を始める新月：2023年11月13日蠍座満月：2023年11月27日双子座 新月・蠍座 ▶自分という花を咲かせるために習慣を意味する6ハウスで起こる新月で「生まれ変わり」がテーマ。
生活習慣を1つでも変えれば、半年後の2024年の蠍座満月の頃には艶やかに変化したあなたがいるだろう。エクササイズをしたり、瞑想をしたり、身体を動かすこと全般にツキがある。ただ、あまりに激しすぎると、アクシデントに見舞われたり、途中でダウンしてしまう可能性も。1駅歩く、4階までは階段を使うなど、無理のない範囲での習慣化を。この日から地道に続ければ、それはあなた自身を確実に変える力となるはずだ。
満月・双子座 ▶もう1つの人格を始動させる秘密を意味する12ハウスで起こる双子座の満月。この時期のラッキーアクションはSNSで匿名のサブアカウントを作ること。正体を明かさず、表では言えないような本音を赤裸々に発信してみては？その背徳感、率直に発言できる爽快感がやみつきになり、密かな楽しみとなりそう。
またこの時期はオンラインでの学びにもツキがある。ただし８ハウスにある冥王星が、あれこれ手出しするよりも、1つを極めることを推奨しているため、これだけは誰にも負けない、というものを身につけるイメージで過ごすといいだろう。
December12月の開運ポイントKEYWORD :人とのご縁を大切に 新月：2023年12月13日射手座満月：2023年12月27日蟹座新月・射手座 ▶公私ともに人脈を広げる人とのつながりを強化する11ハウスで起こる射手座の新月。</p></li><li><h2><a href=./aimee-brigg-net-worth-income-salary-html.html>Aimee Brigg Net Worth, Income, Salary, Earnings, Biography, How much money make?</a></h2><div class=date>August 2024</div><p>Spread the love&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
