“Jessie’s Girl” and appeared naked in the TV drama “Californication”, is baring even more of himself in a new autobiography — including a revelation that he killed a man during the Vietnam war.</p><p><span id=articleText>In 1968, at age 17, the Australian musician was entertaining U.S. troops in Vietnam, when the Americans came under attack. Springfield helped load mortars to repel the onslaught, and one of them killed a Viet Cong soldier.</span></p><p><span id=articleText>“That was a war situation but it is still something that to this day sends a shiver down my spine,” Springfield said, calling it one of his deepest, darkest secrets.</span></p><p><span id=articleText>In the memoir “Late, Late at Night”, Springfield, 61, writes of his lifelong battle with depression in spite of sold-out concerts, more than 17 million album sales and his stint as Dr. Noah Drake on the soap opera “General Hospital”.</span></p><h3 id=title-of-a-story class="c-title lrv-u-margin-b-075">Related Stories</h3><p><span id=articleText>At 16, he tried to hang himself in his backyard shed, but the rope’s knot unraveled.</span></p><p><span id=articleText>“Having suicide ride on my shoulders was not a lot of fun through a lot of my life and surviving that was a real high point for me,” Springfield told Reuters.</span></p><p><span id=articleText>“Once puberty hit, I was pretty much skimming along the bottom, and I am (now) living long enough to understand how to deal with it,” said Springfield.</span></p><p><span id=articleText>After surviving the suicide bid, Springfield saw a window opening: music, which led him to Vietnam, and then in 1972 to the United States, where he became a teen heartthrob and lived the Hollywood high life with girlfriend Linda Blair, at that time the teen star of hit movie, “The Exorcist.”</span></p><p><span id=articleText>The career dry spell that followed was resurrected by the Grammy-winning song “Jessie’s Girl” — voted in 2007 as the No.1 karaoke song of all time by Rolling Stone magazine. The song found a new generation of fans when it was used in hit musical TV comedy “Glee” earlier this year.</span></p><p><span id=articleText>“I am amazed actually. I didn’t think it would have the legs it has. I didn’t think it was a hit. There are better songs on the record,” he said.</span></p><p><span id=articleText>The song has overshadowed his 16 other Top 40 hits, like “Don’t Talk to Strangers” and “Love Somebody”.</span></p><p><span id=articleText>“The great thing is it is an iconic song. The bad thing is a lot of people think it is the only song I ever wrote. But I understand that, and I certainly don’t get upset about it.”</span></p><p><span id=articleText>Springfield said a lot of his best songs have come from the depression that still haunts him despite years of therapy. “I think good art does come from a dark place. It’s our struggle to come to terms with things in our own life that, as writers, you write about.”</span></p><p><span id=articleText>SEX, LIES AND FACELIFTS</span></p><p><span id=articleText>The Darkness, or “Mr. D,” as Springfield calls depression, hit again in 1989, and Springfield took a 10-year break from recording music to deal with it.</span></p><p><span id=articleText>He rebounded in 1999 and has since made six albums, plays more than 100 concerts a year and an annual four-day festival in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. In November, the third annual Rick Springfield cruise sails from Miami to the Bahamas.</span></p><p><span id=articleText>“Thank God women like to get together and have a drink. It’s pretty awesome,” said Springfield of the cruises, which attract thousands of predominantly female fans.</span></p><p><span id=articleText>Springfield said he has acquired new, male, fans after his role as a sex and drug-addicted guy in the TV series “Californication”.</span></p><p><span id=articleText>“I guess I finally proved to them I am now not gay. And they like the music…I write from a guy’s point of view.”</span></p><p><span id=articleText>Springfield said that having grown up in a band, he believed it didn’t mean anything to cheat on girlfriends, or on his wife of 26 years, Barbara.</span></p><p><span id=articleText>“It doesn’t excuse me from having done it, and I wear that guilt. But I am human and we want to be together and we want it to work,” he said of his marriage.</span></p><p><span id=articleText>Springfield is currently making a new album, has a documentary coming out next year, plans more acting and completely rules out appearing in “Dancing with the Stars.”</span></p><p><span id=articleText>“That would be a reason my wife would divorce me.”</span></p><p><span id=articleText>After a traumatic experience going under the knife to remove the bags under his 23 year-old eyes, Springfield says he is adamantly against facelifts.</span></p><p><span id=articleText>“You can tell when someone has had a facelift and I haven’t had a facelift, and I look like I haven’t had a facelift…I wouldn’t do that. I am saying it now, but I am hoping I stick to it,” he laughed.</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbvLpbCwp5%2BZv6a8zqurnqpemLyue82erqxnnarAqq%2BMp5ywq19tfbR5yJymp2WinrCsedKpqaKml5u2prjDZpmaqpWoenR8kGxm</p></div><div id=links><a href=./andy-samberg-ethnicity-nationality-race-family-body-measurements-career-html.html>&#171;&nbsp;Andy Samberg Ethnicity, Nationality, Race, Family, Body measurements, career</a>
