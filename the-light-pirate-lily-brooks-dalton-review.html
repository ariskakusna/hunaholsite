change and its devastating effects on the earth and the people struggling to survive there. Told in four parts‚Äîpower, water, light, and time‚Äîit follows a Floridian family as they prepare for an approaching hurricane in a landscape already wrecked by destructive weather patterns and rising sea levels.&nbsp;</p><p>Reminiscent of Delia Owens' Where the Crawdads Sing, readers especially loved Brooks-Dalton's vivid writing style, which @abookandadog says "was beautiful and I was riveted from start to finish." They add, "The character building felt so real, I *almost* cried near the end at a tender moment between two characters." Meanwhile, @bibliokyra shares a similar sentiment and raves, "Brooks-Dalton‚Äôs imaginative and atmospheric writing fully submerges you into this probable and frightening world."</p><p>And while some #ReadWithMC readers thought the pacing slowed during the second half, the first half of the novel truly gripped readers with its intensity. @bookedwithrook writes, "The first half took my breath away... I didn‚Äôt expect so much tensity and emotion right off the bat." Additionally, @whatstephisreading writes, "The pace slowed a bit for me once we got through the first part, but it was still a beautiful story of survival and resilience as Wanda is forced to adapt to the rapidly changing environment around her."&nbsp;</p><p>Each month, we gather up the reviews of our&nbsp;<a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-before-rewrite-localise=https://www.marieclaire.com/culture/a22774815/what-is-read-with-mc/>virtual book club</a>&nbsp;members so anyone else looking for their next great read has a collection of recommendations.

As Florida slips away, Wanda adapts to the changing landscape.</p><p>Wilderness/survival stories are one of my favorite tropes, so I had to pick this up. Wanda is a special and brave main character, reminding me of Kya from Where the Crawdad‚Äôs Sing.</p><p>The first half took my breath away. I don‚Äôt want to say too much about the plot because I enjoyed going into this blind, but I didn‚Äôt expect so much tensity and emotion right off the bat. The second half slowed action-wise, but I still enjoyed it‚Äîexploring themes of community and survival/resilience.</p><p>Overall, a poignant, frightening yet hopeful story.

The story follows a young woman, Wanda, who was tragically born into this uncertain world and must learn how to adapt and survive. This is a captivating, thought-provoking novel that establishes the link between the health of our environment and the health of our societies and governments. Brooks-Dalton‚Äôs imaginative and atmospheric writing fully submerges you into this probable and frightening world. I loved this one & highly recommend for fans of cli-fi and books with a dash of magical realism."&nbsp;</p><p class=newsletter-form__strapline>Marie Claire email subscribers get intel on fashion and beauty trends, hot-off-the-press celebrity news, and more.

I can‚Äôt believe how well the mood of this story changed and morphed. As we got into the 'after' I started to realize the difference in the two 'halves' of the story and how they felt like two different books but it was meant to be because the world had changed that much. The writing was beautiful and I was riveted from start to finish. The character building felt so real, I *almost* cried near the end at a tender moment between two characters.</p><p>I felt like I needed to immediately start this book over just to absorb it all some more.

I didn‚Äôt read much about this and somehow assumed it was this sci dystopian book a la Waterworld. It is not. The book is told in 4 parts (power, light, air, time‚Ä¶) and begins with a catastrophic series of events in the lower US (Florida). As climate change wreaks havoc on the land it also destroys the lives of our main characters. We follow young Wanda as she grows up in abandoned Florida among the changing landscape and ways of life. She finds family amongst neighbors and those trying to survive.</p><p>‚ú®My Thoughts‚ú®<br>The book is written with similar feeling to Joyce Maynard‚Äôs Count the Ways in an almost observant set back manner but so touching and affecting. I loved the characters, the story and the atmosphere. It‚Äôs all beautiful and heartbreaking. The descriptions of the land were so well done I could picture the new landscapes and imagine the suffocating heat. In the end this is a book about adaption and change in the face of constant unpredictable chaos. It‚Äôs definitely a warning cry as well and heartbreaking to imagine this as our future. Pick it up in audio or written form, I rotated between the two which were equally great.</p><p>My Rating: ‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏èüí´(4.5/5 stars)"&nbsp;</p><p>‚Äî<a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-url="https://www.instagram.com/p/Ckic96MLhyC/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link" referrerpolicy=no-referrer-when-downgrade data-hl-processed=none>@elizabookworm</a></p><p>"The Light Pirate by Lily Brooks-Dalton</p><p>This story follows a Florida family as devastating weather patterns wreak havoc on the state's infrastructure.</p><p>I didn't know what to expect going in but really enjoyed this one.

Wanda bears the burden of the name of the storm which took her mother from her. As Wanda grows from infancy into adolescence, she experiences the losses and the wonder that comes from growing up in a coastal area devastated by the effects of climate change. Wanda knows from a young age that the loss of her mother isn't the only thing that makes her different from other children - she feels power and knowledge brewing in her mind and body.</p><p>This book isn't a typical narrative - there's no huge climax, no solid, satisfying ending. It gives the reader snapshots into the life of Wanda and her family, both biological and chosen. It's a quiet but powerful experience, and an exploration of what our world will look like when natural resources and habitable land dwindle.</p><p>I don't want to give away anything else, and I HIGHLY recommend giving this one a listen on&nbsp;<a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-url=https://www.instagram.com/librofm/ referrerpolicy=no-referrer-when-downgrade data-hl-processed=none>@librofm</a>&nbsp;or your local library's audiobook selection."&nbsp;</p><p>‚Äî<a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-url="https://www.instagram.com/p/CmUoXR1ukWl/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link" referrerpolicy=no-referrer-when-downgrade data-hl-processed=none>@rinpwithbee</a><br></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rq3RopycpJGev6Z6wqikaJulocG2vsRomainm6h8tbTEZqOin5iperG10ZqrnmWcnrm6ecGrpqijo2KxorjTqKVmqpWrtqbDjg%3D%3D</p></div><div id=links><a href=./selena-gomez-ai-music-mental-health-1235594616.html>&#171;&nbsp;Selena Gomez Talks AI in Music, Never Watching Her Documentary Again</a>
