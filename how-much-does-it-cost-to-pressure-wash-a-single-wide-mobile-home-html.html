If you have a brick home, you can have it pressure washed for $0.15–$0.40 per square foot, depending on the size.</p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-148 data-inserter-version=2></span><p></p><h3>When it comes to pressure washers, how much do they charge per hour?</h3><p>It costs between $60 and $100 per hour for a professional pressure washing service. An area of 1200 sq.ft. will take 6 hours and cost between $360 and $600 to complete at a total cost of between $360 and $600.

Specifically, the jet wash in a power washing machine utilises heated water, whereas the water in a pressure washer does not have the same temperature. It is especially recommended for surfaces such as concrete, which will not be damaged by the use of high-pressure water washing equipment.</p><p></p><h3>What steps should I take to start a small pressure washing business?</h3><p>Working for a power washing company or enrolling in certificate programmes at continuing education or trade schools are both excellent ways to gain experience.

Instead, depending on the situation, you should use a high-pressure washer.</p><p>To find out how much it costs to rent a power washer from Home Depot, click here.</p><p>It is not included because the only place that offered an electric pressure cleaner for hire was Home Depot, and it cost $35 per day.
