In the end, it is Raven (in her White form) that defeats Trigon using her own strengthened mystical abilities of pure light to obliterate Trigon, undoing the destruction he had caused in the process.<h2>Why did Trigon fight Darkseid?</h2>Having taken over Superman's body and getting rid of the liquid Kryptonite that left him de-powered, Trigon turns his attention to Darkseid, interested in fighting him to see how powerful a New God is. The two begin fighting as Trigon quickly gains the upper hand.<h2>Who is stronger Trigon or Darkseid true form?</h2>Trigon would be able to defeat Darkseid in his basic form from Prime-Earth.
