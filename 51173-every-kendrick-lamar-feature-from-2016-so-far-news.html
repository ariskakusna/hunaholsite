style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p>Kendrick Lamar started the year off strong with the release of <strong>untitled. unmastered</strong>, but he's also been keeping bust with guest appearances, showing up on range of records from fellow TDE members, underground emcees, and the biggest pop acts going.</p><p>No Kendrick feature is the same, but they're all at least worth a listen, most of them much more than that. With that being said, take a look through the many features K-Dot has put out this year in the gallery above. Let us know what your favorites (and least favorites) are in the comments section. Do any of these hint at what the next Kendrick project might sound like?</p><p><br><h2>No More Parties In L.A.</h2></p><p>Every Kendrick Lamar Feature From 2016 So Far</p><p><strong>Kanye West- "No More Parties In L.A." (Feat. Kendrick Lamar)</strong></p><p>Kendrick's very first feature of the year is still among his biggest and best. The rapper's guest appearance on Kanye West's The Life Of Pablo bonus track finds him rapping over a Madlib beat and bringing out the best bars in his collaborator.</p><p><span><strong>Quotable Lyrics:</strong></span><br>The opportunity, the proper top of breast and booty cheek<br>The pop community, I mean these bitches come with union fee<br>And I want two of these, moving units through consumer streets<br>Then my shoe released, she was kicking in gratuity<br>And yeah G, I was all for it<br>She said, "K Lamar, you kind of dumb to be a poet"<br>I'ma put you on game, for the lames that don't know, they're a rookie<br>Instagram is the best way to promote some pussy</p><p><h2>The New Cupid</h2></p><p>Every Kendrick Lamar Feature From 2016 So Far</p><p><strong>BJ The Chicago Kid - "The New Cupid"&nbsp;(Feat. Kendrick Lamar)</strong></p><p>Kendrick's collab with BJ The Chicago Kid brings out the loverboy in the rapper, as he gets poetic and romantic on the R&B single. He even throws in his own catchy refrain that comes in twice in his verse; "Skrt, skrt, skrt, pump my brake, pump my brake /&nbsp;Mini skirt, skirt, skirt, don't walk away, walk away."</p><p><span><strong>Quotable Lyrics:</strong><a href=# class="referent referent--yellow" data-id=8828475 rel="nofollow noopener"><br></a></span>I'm fishing for compliments<br>This is a fairy tale, I know you very well<br>Fuck all your promises, I know what time it is<br>I'm just a realist, I am the realest<br>Reality is fatality cursed on the future for family, wife and some kids</p><p></p><p><h2>Ain't That Funkin' Kinda Hard On You</h2></p><p>Every Kendrick Lamar Feature From 2016 So Far</p><p><strong>Funkadelic- "Ain't That Funkin Hard&nbsp;On You?" (Feat. Kendrick Lamar & Ice Cube)</strong></p><p>After working with George Clinton on To Pimp A Butterfly, Kendrick sounds right at home on this P-Funk beat, as well as beside one of his West Coast rap predecessors, Ice Cube.</p><p><span><strong>Quotable Lyrics:&nbsp;</strong></span><br>Why you hate to work for it<br>The reason why I hate to wait for it?<br>See a nine to five was so jive turkey<br>But when Thanksgiving came that check didn’t hurt me<br>You plead the fifth, I read the fifth amendment<br>We both criminals with bad intention<br>They say time heals all<br>But if I could short cut my success motherfunk all y'all</p><p></p><p><h2>Freedom</h2></p><p>Every Kendrick Lamar Feature From 2016 So Far</p><p><strong>Beyonce - "Freedom" (Feat. Kendrick Lamar)</strong></p><p>Beyonce's highly personal&nbsp;<strong>LEMONADE</strong>&nbsp;didn't leave too much room for guest appearances, but Kendrick Lamar (alongside The Weeknd and Jack White) was one of the few to make the cut. He comes through loud and clear on "Freedom," a pro-black protest record that is powerful both in words and performance. Bey and K-Dot both sound even more immense than the Just Blaze instrumental beneath them.</p><p><span><strong>Quotable Lyrics:&nbsp;</strong></span><br>Ten Hail Marys, I meditate for practice<br>Channel 9 news tell me I'm movin' backwards<br>Eight blocks left, death is around the corner<br>Seven misleadin' statements 'bout my persona<br>Six headlights wavin' in my direction<br>Five-O askin' me what's in my possession<br>Yeah, I keep runnin', jump in the aqueducts<br>Fire hydrants and hazardous<br>Smoke alarms on the back of us<br>But mama, don't cry for me, ride for me<a href=# class="referent referent--yellow" data-id=9043531 rel="nofollow noopener"><br></a></p><p><h2>Survive</h2></p><p>Every Kendrick Lamar Feature From 2016 So Far</p><p><strong>Mistah F.A.B. - "Survive" (feat. Kendrick Lamar, Crooked I and Kobe Honeycutt)</strong></p><p>Not just anyone can score a Kendrick verse, which gives you an idea of the level of respect Mistah F.A.B. has in the West Coast. K-Dot opens his Son Of A Pimp 2 track, "Survive," making for one of the lesser heard verses from the TDE rapper this year. As he does to pretty much every verse, K-Dot brings his A-game here, musing on the violent cycle of the prison industrial complex.&nbsp;</p><p><span><strong>Quotable Lyrics:</strong></span><br>I mean the cycle just continue<br>The vital information and fine print on the menu<br>So you'll never read it even if a n*gga lend you<br>Money out my own pocket, to make it right<br>You'll still attend to<br>Be on them corners with stop signs and a nine<br>Cause nine times out of ten, MAC 11's cry<br>And twelve died yesterday and if anyone divides<br>The six that carried you eventually lose they lives<br>True story</p><p><h2>Black THougHts</h2></p><p>Every Kendrick Lamar Feature From 2016 So Far</p><p><strong>ScHoolboy Q - "Black THougHts"</strong></p><p>"Black THougHts" is an uncredited appearance for Kendrick, but any TDE fan should recognize his distorted voice on the hook from the<strong> Blank Face LP</strong> deep cut. It's an effective Easter egg that hearkens back to the collective's tendency to work within their small universe of collaborators. It feels like an in-joke between friends, an appeal of TDE that isn't talked about enough.</p><p><span><strong>Quotable Lyrics:</strong></span><br>The joke's on you, mothafucka<br>The loc is on you, mothafucka<br>I warned you, it's karma<br>Black thoughts and marijuana, it's karma</p><p><h2>THat Part</h2></p><p>Every Kendrick Lamar Feature From 2016 So Far</p><p><strong>ScHoolboy Q - "THat Part (Black Hippy Remix)"</strong></p><p>ScHoolboy Q's "THat Part" was the biggest hit to emerge from TDE this year, so it was only fitting that the whole Black Hippy crew hopped on it. Q, Ab-Soul, Jay Rock, and Kendrick always make it difficult to pick a favorite verse, but K-Dot does make a solid bid for the title, entering with an echoing vocal, as he spits dexterous boasts, keeping his rhyme schemes tight and complex throughout. It's hard to beat Kendrick on a purely technical level, and this is him at his most detail-oriented.</p><p><span><strong>Quotable Lyrics:</strong></span><br>Deny me from an Ivy school<br>Applyin' me to the street I slept<br>I quietly had to hold this tool<br>Reminding me of the block I repped<br>The turf I stepped, the church and the earth I blessed<br>The first I guessed the alert was the murk I chef<br>That hearse the flirt with perks of a kill confessed<br>Dispersed the worst, the first 48 addressed<br>The search and laws and verse of the birth I nest<br>The awe, the curse of a pose in zest<br>The good, the flaws, the pain to reverse what's left</p><p><h2>Skyline To</h2></p><p>Every Kendrick Lamar Feature From 2016 So Far</p><p><strong>Frank Ocean - "Skyline To" (Feat. Kendrick Lamar)</strong></p><p>As with many of the uncredited features on Frank Ocean's new album, Kendrick's is fairly low-key, but a close listening will reveal his voice a little deeper in the mix, providing ad-libs and backing vocals.<br><strong><br><span>Quotable Lyrics:</span></strong><span><a href=# class="referent referent--yellow referent--highlighted" data-id=10264738 rel="nofollow noopener"><br></a></span>On comes the evening<br>Gold seeking ends<br>Piece in my hands worth twice than a friend<br>And two limbs over shoulder, carried away</p><p><h2>What's Wrong</h2></p><p>Every Kendrick Lamar Feature From 2016 So Far</p><p><strong>Isaiah Rashad - "Wat's Wrong" (Feat. Kendrick Lamar & <a href=# class=text-word rel>Zacari</a>)</strong></p><p>As a TDE artist, it was assumed Isaiah Rashad would have a Kendrick verse on his official debut album <strong>The Sun's Tirade</strong>, and "Wat's Wrong" was that moment. Not many can keep up with K-Dot on a track, but Isaiah does a fine job. Kendrick meanwhile, provides the spectacle that make his features so sought after. He makes some "best rapper alive" claims, and in the moment, you may be inclined to agree.</p><p><span><strong>Quotable Lyrics:</strong></span><a href=# class="referent referent--yellow" data-id=10318790 rel="nofollow noopener"><br></a>I told Zay, I'm the best rapper since twenty five<br>Been like that for a while now, I'm twenty-nine<br>Any nigga that disagree is a fuckin' liar<br>Pardon me, see my alter ego was Gemini<br>He and I been around ever since Reagan was criticized<br>Might stay in the Trump tower for one week<br>Spray paint all the walls and smoke weed<br>Fuck them and fuck y'all and fuck me</p><p><h2>Holy Key</h2></p><p>Every Kendrick Lamar Feature From 2016 So Far</p><p><strong>DJ Khaled - "Holy Key" (Feat. Kendrick Lamar, Big Sean & Betty Wright)</strong></p><p>DJ Khaled truly brought a lot more out of his collaborators on his latest compilation, even when they were forced into silly key pun concepts. Kendrick Lamar gets away with not mentioning keys, lions, or cloth talk in his 16, and its for the best, as he sets into one of his most fiery 16s of the year, building up to the breathless, emotional delivery that some of his best songs have featured.</p><p><span><strong>Quotable Lyrics:</strong></span><br>Brand endorsement joining forces with sorcerers signing me<br>Law enforcement their forces, tortures us with violent speed<br>Fuck your boss's employment my joy is to see all you bleed<br>Two knew Royce's with choices of color my desire need<br>Crab and Oyster with gorgeous abortions, I require thee<br>Flesh and poison the point is the reason<br>You won't die in peace</p><p><h2>The Greatest</h2></p><p>Every Kendrick Lamar Feature From 2016 So Far</p><p><strong>Sia - "The Greatest" (Feat. Kendrick Lamar)</strong></p><p>While his album material may be getting more and more experimental, Kendrick is not afraid to lend his voice to pop singles (remember the "Bad Blood" remix?). On Sia's "The Greatest" he once again tries out his abilities as a crossover artist. While maybe not successful as some of his more pop-minded peers,&nbsp;Kendrick certainly proves he has some range with this one.</p><p><span><strong>Quotable Lyrics:<br></strong></span>I transform with pressure - I'm hands-on with effort<br>I fell twice before, my bounce back was special<br>Letdowns'll get you, and the critics will test you<br>But the strong'll survive, another scar may bless you, ah<span><strong><br></strong></span><br></p><p><h2>Really Doe</h2></p><p>Every Kendrick Lamar Feature From 2016 So Far</p><p><strong>Danny Brown - "Really Doe" (Feat. Kendrick Lamar, Ab-Soul & <a href=# class=text-word rel>Earl Sweatshirt</a>)</strong></p><p>Kendrick supplies both the hook and a verse of "Really Doe," and surrounded by skilled emcees, it's hard to give him the gold medal, but he carries the baton as well as any of his talented peers on the track. In the end, it's a team victory.</p><p><span><strong>Quotable Lyrics:</strong></span><br>Bet a thousand, shoot a thousand<a href=# class="referent referent--yellow" data-id=10462731 rel="nofollow noopener"><br></a>Things a nigga do for thousands<br>Made a million counting sheep<br>Gave it all to public housin'<br>Taking off to Abu Dhabi<br>Beamin' up the motor, Scotty<br>Talking to promoters, Scotty<br>Everybody know it's Gotti<br>Murder one, you've heard of them<br>The rev undid, the all day madness<br>Got it off the wipe it off, the evidence, the blood on mattress<a href=# class="referent referent--yellow" data-id=10465673 rel="nofollow noopener"><br></a><br></p><p><h2>Goosebumps</h2></p><p>Every Kendrick Lamar Feature From 2016 So Far</p><p><strong><a href=# class=text-word rel>Travis Scott</a> - "Goosebumps" (Feat. Kendrick Lamar)</strong></p><p>Travis Scott tends to inspire great performances from his collaborators, whether it be <a href=# class=text-word rel>Young Thug</a> and Rich Homie on "Mamacita" or <a href=# class=text-word rel>Justin Bieber</a> on "Maria, I'm Drunk." His new album, <strong>Birds In The Trap Sing McKnight</strong> is filled with memorable guest appearances, and Kendrick Lamar <a href=# rel>might very well have the best of the bunch</a>. It's a reminder is that Kendrick's ability as a performer is on par with his lyricism, as he introduces a delivery that stop-starts, melts, doubles, and squeals. As with most Kendrick verses, the lyrics on paper do not do it justice.</p><p><span><strong>Quotable Lyrics:</strong></span><br>I want to press my like, yeah, I wanna press my<br>I want a green light, I wanna be like<br>I wanna press my line, yeah<br>I want to take that ride, yeah<br>I’m gonna press my lime<br>I wanna green light, I wanna be like, I wanna press my<br>Mama, dear, spare your feelings<br>I'm reliving moments, peeling more residual<a href=# class="referent referent--yellow referent--highlighted" data-id=10435824 rel="nofollow noopener"><br></a><br></p><p><h2>God Is Fair, Sexy Nasty</h2></p><p>Every Kendrick Lamar Feature From 2016 So Far</p><p><strong>Mac Miller - "God Is Fair, Sexy Nasty" (Feat. Kendrick Lamar)</strong></p><p>Mac Miller has suggested in interviews that he wanted to put Kendrick on a song that didn't *sound* like a Kendrick song. "God Is Fair" is definitely an experiment, and putting K-Dot on the chorus is an unconventional move, but given his underrated ability to craft hooks, it's still a smart move, making for a perfect closing track for Mac's <strong>The Divine Feminine</strong>.</p><p><h2>Don't Wanna Know</h2></p><p>Every Kendrick Lamar Feature From 2016 So Far</p><p><strong>Maroon 5 - "Don't Wanna Know" (Feat. Kendrick Lamar)</strong></p><p>The latest Kendrick verse, "Don't Wanna Know" is far from the strongest, suggesting that K-Dot's weakness may be stretching his unconventional style to radio. However, he sounds perfectly comfortable on the track, which seems like a potential hit. More Kendrick on the radio means more kids coming back to <strong>To Pimp A Butterfly</strong> and <strong>good kid, M.A.A.D. city</strong>. Hard to argue with that.</p><p><span><strong>Quotable Lyrics:</strong></span><br>No more "please stop"<br>No more hashtag boo'd up screenshots<br>No more tryin' make me jealous on your birthday<br>You know just how I made you better on your birthday, oh<br>Do he do you like this, do he woo you like this?<br>Do he lay it down for you, touch your poona like this?<br>Matter fact, never mind, we'll let the past be<br>May be his right now, but your body's still me, woah</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbvTp5ywoJmltbC8jZympmdlZn54f4yerZ6qqWK4prrDq6Cco12hrq6t0Wadnpmkqr%2BmecWrpqZlYmV%2Bd3nSqGSfmaJiu6bD0g%3D%3D</p></div><div id=links><a href=./geodist-php.html>&#171;&nbsp;Geometric Distribution Calculator</a>
