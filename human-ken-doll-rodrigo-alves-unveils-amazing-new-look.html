Glamorous, beautiful and feminine," she told the Mirror.</p><p>"For years I tried to live my life as a man. I had a fake six-pack put in, I had fake muscles in my arms, but I was lying to myself.</p><span class=ad__heading data-test-ui=ad__heading data-ad-env=both>Advertisement</span><a class=ad__link data-test-ui=ad__link href=# data-ad-env=both>Advertise with NZME.</a><p>"I'm a woman and have always had a feminine brain.

I'm very excited," Roddy told the publication.</p><p>She will then have face feminisation surgery that involves an incision at the top of her scalp, allowing doctors to reshape her forehead, give her an eye lift, lip lift and middle face lift.</p><p>"I'm having my Adam's apple removed, my jawline shaved and my chin modified," she said.</p><p>Roddy, who is from Brazil and lives in London, was recently warned by doctors that her health was at risk after having an 11th nose job to fix a botched procedure.</p><p>In 2016, then still known as Rodrigo, her nose became infected after a sixth nose job.</p><span class=ad__heading data-test-ui=ad__heading data-ad-env=both>Advertisement</span><a class=ad__link data-test-ui=ad__link href=# data-ad-env=both>Advertise with NZME.</a><p>It left her unable to breathe, but despite doctors warning the nose could become gangrenous and would need to be removed, Roddy had five more reconstructive nose jobs, with the most recent in January 2019.</p><p>Roddy admitted it took a lot of courage to admit she was transgender with her quest to become a woman dating back to when she was little and dressing in her mum's clothes.</p><p>In fact, Roddy had breasts as a child, and when she was 17, she had them removed.</p><p>A hormone dysfunction caused her breast tissue to grow at the rate of her female peers and left her with a pair of breasts at the age of 16.</p><p>She spent about $3500 on the procedure, which sparked the start of a surgery addiction that has spanned 19 years.</p><h2 class=article__heading>Bullying</h2><p>She revealed she was bullied at school because of her "femininity", describing it as a "traumatic" experience, and said she continued to face criticism over her changing appearance into adulthood.</p><span class=ad__heading data-test-ui=ad__heading data-ad-env=both>Advertisement</span><a class=ad__link data-test-ui=ad__link href=# data-ad-env=both>Advertise with NZME.</a><p>"Behind closed doors, I've been living as a woman for the last three months," she said. "I love it and everything that comes with it – going to nice hair salons and getting my nails, eyebrows and eyelashes done. Buying dresses and high heels and wearing sexy lingerie.</p><p>"But I have been trolled and called a freak and a weirdo, so of course I am nervous about how people will react," she told the Mirror.</p><p>She hopes people will accept her as a woman and not judge or ridicule her.</p><p>Roddy believes the bullying led to her success, having moved to London at 20 where she studied public relations at university, followed by a stint on Celebrity Big Brother UKin 2018.</p><h2 class=article__heading>Sex life and dating</h2><p>Roddy, who is attracted to straight men, said her sex drive had decreased, but it doesn't bother her.</p><p>"People always thought I was gay and initially I did too.

I never had a gay relationship," she said.</p><span class=ad__heading data-test-ui=ad__heading data-ad-env=both>Advertisement</span><a class=ad__link data-test-ui=ad__link href=# data-ad-env=both>Advertise with NZME.</a><p>"I have always been attracted to straight men because I am a straight woman.

And women look at me because they want to copy what I'm wearing."</p><p>Roddy said it was a completely different type of attention to what she was receiving prior to her transition.</p><p>"Before, people looked at me because I looked very androgynous and weird for a man," she said.</p><p>"Now I hope they are looking because they think I am a beautiful woman."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r8bHnqmapJRjsLB6zbNmpaGWmsC1xcueZqGtnZa7brfEp2Sdp5yherO7w6ugoKddlrm3sdJmrKeulZ65tHnAppizoZ6ceq%2Bx1majqKebZJ%2BXoq6AhIeReIyPk5awkIKEb4R6gpaZrXBraA%3D%3D</p></div><div id=links><a href=./1591570-face-work-northern-group-asks-senator-ndume-face-primary-assignment.html>&#171;&nbsp;&amp;quot;Prioritise National Matters&amp;quot;: Nothern Youths Tell Senator Ndume</a>
